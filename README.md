### Lay Summary
SPRINT determined that treating individuals to have systolic blood pressure (SBP) near 120mmHg was better than 140mmHg. Although the average SBP of subjects within treatment groups differed, not all subjects had measures near their target. By grouping subjects according to actual SBP measures, rather than treatment group, we found that those with SBP >140mmHg were at increased risk for cardiovascular disease outcomes, while the risk of those with SBP 115-140mmHg was not substantially different.
